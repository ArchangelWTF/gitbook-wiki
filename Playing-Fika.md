# Getting started

This page is dedicated to demonstrate how to host or join a raid with Fika to play with your friends. Before continuing, ensure that you followed all the steps to [host your Fika server](https://github.com/project-fika/Fika-Documentation/wiki/03.-Hosting-a-Fika-server) or [join a Fika server](https://github.com/project-fika/Fika-Documentation/wiki/04.-Joining-a-Fika-server).

# Hosting a raid

- Start `SPT.Launcher.exe`
- Login to your account
- Start the game
- Click "Escape From Tarkov" in the main menu
- Choose PMC or SCAV
- Choose a raid location and time phase
- Click "Next" in Practice Game Mode screen
- Click "Next" in Insurance screen
- Click "Host Raid" in Lobby screen
- Set the amount of players (including you) that will join your raid
- Press "Start"

Once your raid is loaded, you'll see "Waiting for X players." This means your friends can now see your raid in the lobby screen and join it.

The raid will start when all players joined the raid and loaded the map. You will spawn together by default.

# Joining a raid

- Start `SPT.Launcher.exe`

- Click "Escape From Tarkov" in the main menu
- Choose PMC or SCAV
- Choose a raid location and time phase

# Additional info

- You cannot join mid-raid as a PMC or SCAV. You have to join the raid while it's waiting for players.
- The raid host is providing all the AI and spawn logic. If the raid host leaves or crashes, the raid dies.
- If a player crashes, he can rejoin the raid (excepted the raid host).

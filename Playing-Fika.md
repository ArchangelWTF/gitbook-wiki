# Playing Fika

## Getting started

This section describes the steps to create or join a Fika raid to play with your friends. Before continuing, ensure that you followed all the steps to [host your Fika server](installing-fika/hosting-a-fika-server/) or [join a Fika server](installing-fika/joining-a-fika-server/).

## Hosting a raid

* Start `SPT.Launcher.exe`
* Login to your account
* Start the game
* Click "Escape From Tarkov" in the main menu
* Choose PMC or SCAV
* Choose a raid location and time phase
* Click "Next" in Practice Game Mode screen
* Click "Next" in Insurance screen
* Click "Host Raid" in Lobby screen
* Press "Start"

Once your raid is loaded, you'll see "Waiting for X players." This means your friends can now see your raid in the lobby screen and join it.

When all players joined, you can start the raid.

## Joining a raid

* Start `SPT.Launcher.exe`
* Login to your account
* Start the game
* Click "Escape From Tarkov" in the main menu
* Choose PMC or SCAV
* Choose a raid location and time phase
* Click "Next" in Practice Game Mode screen
* Click "Next" in Insurance screen
* Click "Join" in the raid list.

The raid will start when all players joined the raid and loaded the map. You will spawn together by default.

## Additional info

* You cannot join mid-raid as a PMC or SCAV. You have to join the raid while it's waiting for players.
* The raid host is providing all the AI and spawn logic. If the raid host leaves or crashes, the raid dies.
* If a player crashes, they can rejoin the raid (except the raid host).

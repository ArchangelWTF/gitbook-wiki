# VPN

{% hint style="warning" %}
Custom firewalls such as **BitDefender** may block your connection while playing. Make sure that you allow the connection or temporarily disable it while playing!
{% endhint %}

* Go to the VPN website and install their client.
* Reboot your computer.
* Ensure that you can communicate with the host by pinging their VPN IP. You might need to join their channel/room first.
* Launch `SPT.Launcher.exe`.
* Click the "Settings" button.
* Click "Developer mode"
* Enter the server's **VPN address** in the URL section. DO NOT leave out `http://` and do not add a slash at the end.
* The URL box should look like this: `http://20.21.22.23:6969`.
* Press the arrow on the right corner.
* You should now be able to create your profile and log in to the server.

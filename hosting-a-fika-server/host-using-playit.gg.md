[Playit.gg](https://playit.gg/) is a proxy that makes it possible to host servers without having to port forward, by relaying the game traffic over one of their datacenters. [This guide](https://discuss.playit.gg/t/setup-an-escape-from-tarkov-multiplayer-server-with-spt-fika/3352) will teach you how to use Playit.gg to host a SPT/Fika Server. Editing your http.json is not required.

# Getting started

This section is dedicated for setting up Fika to join a server. The server owner must have followed all the steps in the "Hosting a Fika server" first before you follow the steps below.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Most of the time, connection issues are caused by improper network configuration by the server owner. We cannot stress enough the importance of the server owner taking a few minutes to read the "Hosting a Fika Server" guide and following every step carefully.

Before continuing, make sure: 
- You have followed **ALL** the steps in "Installing Fika."
- You can start the game and reach the main menu.
- You can see the Fika watermark in the bottom-left corner.
- You have **NO** other mods than Fika installed.

# Joining a raid

Joining a raid is simple, though different from live EFT. Instead of inviting your friends to your group, you must choose the same raid location and time as the raid host. Of course, the raid host must first follow the correct steps to [host a raid](https://github.com/project-fika/Fika-Documentation/wiki/05.-Playing-Fika#hosting-a-raid).

After the insurance screen, you'll reach the lobby, where you can see all active raids. Simply click the "Join" button, and you will immediately connect to the raid. You'll be able to play together once the raid is fully loaded for everyone.

The raid will only begin if the expected number of players is reached. The host must set the expected number of players when creating the raid.

> [!WARNING]
> If you encounter a message saying that the connection failed, this means that the host's network configuration is invalid. Please ask the server owner to refer to the [Hosting a Fika server](https://github.com/project-fika/Fika-Documentation/wiki/03.-Hosting-a-Fika-server) section.

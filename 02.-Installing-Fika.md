# Before installing Fika
**Always** keep in mind that Fika is an unofficial [SPT](https://sp-tarkov.com/#download) mod. You **must** have a working SPT installation before attempting to install Fika. There is absolutely no point in trying to install Fika before you ensure that SPT is working first. 

This means that you must be able to start a game in SPT without any issues, and you should not be running any mods before installing Fika. Please ensure this is the case before continuing with the next steps. If you are unsure how to install SPT, please follow their instructions [here](https://hub.sp-tarkov.com/files/file/672-spt-installer/) and come back here once they are completed.

# Prerequisites
- You must have an up-to-date and working installation of SPT. Bleeding edge versions of SPT are *NOT* supported.
- Identify your SPT installation folder. This will be referred to as `SPT folder`.

# Installation
- Extract "Fika-Plugin" to your SPT folder
- Extract "Fika-Server" to your SPT folder
- Start `SPT.Server.exe`

- Start `SPT.Launcher.exe`, create/log in to your account and start the game
- You should get a Fika disclaimer when entering the menu and see the Fika watermark at the bottom left corner. If not, see the Troubleshooting section
